Et apparuérunt illis dispertítæ linguæ tamquam ignis, sedítque supra síngulos eórum: et repléti sunt omnes Spíritu Sancto, et cœpérunt loqui váriis linguis, prout Spíritus Sanctus dabat éloqui illis. Erant autem in Jerúsalem habitántes Judæi, viri religiósi ex omni natióne, quæ sub cælo est. Facta autem hac voce, convénit multitúdo, et mente confúsa est, quóniam audiébat unusquísque lingua sua illos loquéntes. Stupébant autem omnes, et mirabántur, dicéntes: Nonne ecce omnes isti, qui loqúuntur, Galilæi sunt? Et quómodo nos audívimus unusquísque linguam nostram, in qua nati sumus? Parthi et Medi, et Ælamítæ, et qui hábitant Mesopotámiam, Judæam, et Cappadóciam, Pontum, et Asíam, Phrýgiam, et Pamphýliam, Ægýptum et partes Líbyæ, quæ est circa Cyrénen, et ádvenæ Románi, Judæi quoque et Prosélyti, Cretes et Arabes: audivímus eos loquéntes nostris linguis magnália Dei.","When the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place; and suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak. Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue. And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these that speak Galileans? And how have we heard every man our own tongue wherein we were born? Parthians and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Lybia about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews also, and Proselytes, Cretes and Arabians; we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God"],"alleluia":["ELUIA - Psalm 103. 30","ALLELÚIA, alleluia.

Et sermónem quem audístis, non est meus: sed ejus, qui misit me, Patris. Hæc locútus sum vobis, apud vos manens. Paráclitus autem Spíritus Sanctus, quem mittet Pater in nómine meo, illo vos docébit ómnia et súggeret quæcúmque díxero vobis. Pacem relínquo vobis, pacem meam do vobis: non quómodo mundus dat, ego do vobis. Non turbétur cor vestrum neque formídet. Audístis quia ego dixi vobis: Vado et venio ad vos. Si diligerétis me, gauderétis útique, quia vado ad Patrem: quia Pater major me est. Et nunc dixi vobis priúsquam fiat: ut cum factum fúerit, credátis. Jam non multa loquar vobíscum. Venit enim princeps mundi hujus, et in me non habet quidquam. Sed ut cognóscat mundus, quia díligo Patrem, et sicut mandátum dedit mihi Pater, sic fácio.","At that time Jesus said to His disciples If any one love Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and will make Our abode in him: he that loveth Me not keepeth not My words. And the word which you have heard is not Mine; but the Father’s who sent Me. These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you. But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid. You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved Me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass you may believe. I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in Me he hath not any thing. But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father hath given Me commandment so do I"],"offertory":["Psalm 67. 29-30","CONFÍRMA hoc, Deus, quod operátus es in nobis: a templo tuo, quod est in Jerúsalem, tibi ófferent reges múnera.
