Attend, O My people, to My law; incline your ears to the words of My mouth. Glory be to the Father"],"collect":["","OMNÍPOTENS et miséricors Deus, univérsa nobis adversántia propitiátus exclúde: ut mente et córpore páriter expedíti, quæ tua sunt, líberis méntibus exsequámur. Per Dóminum.","Almighty and merciful God, in Thy goodness keep us, we beseech Thee, from all things hurtful; that we, being ready both in body and soul, may accomplish those things which belong to Thy service.

Propter quod deponéntes mendácium, loquímini veritátem unusquísque cum próximo suo: quóniam sumus ínvicem membra. Irascímini, et nolíte peccáre: sol non óccidat super iracúndiam vestram. Nolíte locum dare diábolo: qui furabátur, jam non furétur, magis atem labóret, operándo mánibus suis, quod bonum est, ut hábeat unde tríbuat necessitátem patiénti.","Brethren: Be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man, who according to God is created in justice and holiness of truth. Wherefore, putting away lying, speak ye the truth every man with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. Be angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your anger. Give not place to the devil. He that stole, let him now steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need"],"gradual":["Ps 140: 2","DIRIGÁTUR orátio mea, sicut incénsum in conspéctu tuo, Dómine.

Alleluia"],"gospel":["Matthew 22: 1-14","IN illo témpore: Loquebátur Jesus princípibus sacerdótum et pharisæis in parábolis dicens: Símile factum est regnum cælórum hómini regi, qui fecit núptias fílio suo. Et misit servos suos vocáre invitátos ad núptias, et nolébant veníre. Iterum misit álios servos, dicens: Dícite invitátis: Ecce prándium meum parávi, tauri mei et altília occísa sunt, et ómnia paráta: veníte ad núptias. Illi autem neglexérunt: et abiérunt, álius in villam suam, álius vero ad negotiatiónem suam: réliqui vero tenuérunt servos ejus, et contuméliis afféctos occidérunt. Rex autem cum audísset, irátus est: et, missis exercítibus suis, pérdidit homicídas illos et civitátem illórum succéndit. Tunc ait servis suis: Núptiæ quidem parátæ sunt, sed qui invitáti erant, non fué runt digni. Ite ergo ad éxitus viárum et quoscumque invenéritis vocáte ad núptias. Et egréssi servi ejus in vias, congregavérunt omnes quos invenérunt, malos et bonos: et implétæ sunt núptiæ discumbéntium. Intrávit autem rex ut vidéret discumbéntes, et vidit ibi hóminem non vestítum veste nuptiáli. Et ait illi: Amíce, quómodo huc intrásti non habens vestem nuptiálem? At ille obmútuit. Tunc dixit rex minístris: Ligátis mánibus et pédibus ejus, míttite eum in ténebras exterióres: ibi erit fletus et stridor déntium. Multi enim sunt vocáti, pauci vero elécti.","At that time: Jesus spoke to the chief priests and the Pharisees in parables, saying: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a marriage for his son; and he sent his servants, to call them that were invited to the marriage, and they would not come. Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited: Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my beeves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come ye to the marriage. But they neglected: and went their ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise; and the rest laid hands on his servants, and having treated them contumeliously, put them to death. But when the king had heard of it, he was angry; and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city. Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is ready, but they that were invited were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage. And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good; and the marriage was filled with guests. And the king went in to see the guests; and he saw there a man who had not a wedding garment: and he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment? but he was silent. Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen"],"offertory":["Ps. 137: 7","SANCTIFICÁVIT Móyses altáre Dómino, ófferens super illud holocáusta, et ímmolans víctimas: fecit sacrifícium vespertínum in odórem suavitátis Dómino Deo, in conspéctu fíliórum Israël.","Moses consecrated an altar to the Lord, offering upon it holocausts, and sacrificing victims: he made an evening sacrifice to the Lord God for an odor of sweetness, in the sight of the children of Israel"],"secret":["","DEUS, qui nos, per hujus sacrifícii veneránda commércia, uníus summæ divinitátis partícipes éfficis: præsta, quæsumus: ut, sicut tuam cognóscimus veritátem, sic eam dig nis móribus assequámur.
