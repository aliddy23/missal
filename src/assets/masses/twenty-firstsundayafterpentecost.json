Prócidens autem servus ille, orábat eum, dicens: Patiéntiam habe in me, et ómnia reddam tibi. Misértus autem dóminus servi illíus, dímisit eum, et débitum dimísit ei. Egréssus autem servus ille, invénit unum de consérvis sui, qui debébat ei centum denários: et tenens suffocábat eum, dicens: Redde quod debes. Et prócídens consérvus ejus, rogábat eum, dicens: Patiéntiam habe in me, et ómnia reddam tibi. Ille autem nóluit sed ábiit, et misit eum in cárcerem donec rédderet débitum. Vidéntes autem consérvi ejus quæ fiébant, contristáti sunt valde: et venérunt, et narravérunt dómino suo ómnia, quæ facta fúerant. Tunc vocávit ilium dóminus suus, et ait ilii: Serve nequam, omne débitum dimisi tibi, quóniam rogásti me: nonne ergo opórtuit et te miseréri consérvi tui, sicut et ego tui misértus sum?

And when he had begun to take the account, one was brought to him that owed him ten thousand talents: and as he had not wherewith to pay it, his lord commanded that he should be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment be made. But that servant falling down, besought him saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And the lord of that servant, being moved with pity, let him go and forgave him the debt. But when that servant was gone out, he found one of his fellow servants that owed him a hundred pence: and laying hold of him, he throttled him, saying: Pay what thou owest. And his fellow-servant falling down besought him, saying: have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not but went and cast him into prison till he paid the debt. Now his fellow servants, seeing what was done, were very much grieved and they came and told their lord all that was done. Then his lord called him and saith to him: Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest me; shouldst not thou have had compassion also on thy fellow-servant, even as I had compassion on thee? And his lord being angry, delivered him to the torturers, until he paid all the debt. So also shall my Heavenly Father do to you, if you forgive not every one his brother from your hearts"],"offertory":["Job 1","VIR erat in terra Hus nómine Job: simplex et rectus ac timens Deum: quem Satan pétiit, ut tentáret: et data est ei potéstas a Dómino in facultátes, et in carnem ejus: perdiditque omnem substántiam ipsíus, et fílios: carnem quoque ejus gravi úlcere vulnerávit.","There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, simple, and upright, and fearing God: whom Satan besought that he might tempt: and power was given him from the Lord over his possessions and his flesh; and he destroyed all his substance and his children; and wounded his flesh also with a grievous ulcer"],"secret":["","SÚSCIPE, Dómine, propítius hóstias: quibus et te placári voluísti, et nobis salútem poténti pietáte restítuti.
