Afterwards he went to Athens, where he heard that the converts in Thessalonica were under a severe persecution, ever since his departure; and lest they should lose their fortitude, he sent Timothy to strengthen and comfort them in their sufferings.  In the meantime St. Paul came to Corinth, where he wrote this first Epistle, and also the second to the Thessalonians, both in the same year, being the nineteenth after our Lord's Ascension.  These are the first of his Epistles in the order of time.","ch":[{"name":"1 Thessalonians Chapter 1","desc":"He gives thanks for the grace bestowed on the Thessalonians.","num":1},{"name":"1 Thessalonians Chapter 2","desc":"The sincerity of the apostle's preaching the gospel to them and of their receiving it.","num":2},{"name":"1 Thessalonians Chapter 3","desc":"The apostle's concern and love for the Thessalonians.","num":3},{"name":"1 Thessalonians Chapter 4","desc":"He exhorts them to purity and mutual charity.
