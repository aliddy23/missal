JAMES THE APOSTLE","group":"The Catholic Epistles","desc":"This Epistle is called Catholic or Universal, as formerly were also the two Epistles of St. Peter, the first of St. John and that of St. Jude, because they were not written to any peculiar people or particular person, but to the faithful in general.  It was written by the apostle St. James, called the Less, who was also called the brother of our Lord, being his kinsman (for cousins german with the Hebrews were called brothers).  He was the first Bishop of Jerusalem.  In this Epistle are set forth many precepts appertaining to faith and morals; particularly, that faith without good works will not save a man and that true wisdom is given only from above.  In the fifth chapter he publishes the sacrament of anointing the sick.  It was written a short time before his martyrdom, about twenty-eight years after our Lord's Ascension.","ch":[{"name":"James Chapter 1","desc":"The benefit of tribulations.  Prayer with faith.
