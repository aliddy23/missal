Afterwards the Apostle, on a journey to Nicopolis, a city of Macedonia, wrote this Epistle to Titus, in which he directs him to ordain bishops and priests for the different cities, shewing him the principal qualities necessary for a bishop.  He also gives him particular advice for his own conduct to his flock, exhorting him to hold to strictness of discipline, but seasoned with lenity.  It was written about thirty-three years after our Lord's Ascension.","ch":[{"name":"Titus Chapter 1","desc":"What kind of men he is to ordain priests.
