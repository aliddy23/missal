{"num":56,"short":"Ephesians","name":"Epistle of St. Paul to the Ephesians","fmlname":"THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS","group":"The Epistles","desc":"Ephesus was the capital of Lesser Asia, and celebrated for the temple of Diana, to which the most part of the people of the East went frequently to worship.  But St. Paul having preached the Gospel there, for two years the first time and afterwards for about a year, converted many.  He wrote this Epistle to them when he was a prisoner in Rome; and sent it by Tychicus.  He admonishes them to hold firmly the faith which they had received and warns them, and also those of the neighbouring cities, against the sophistry of philosophers and doctrine of false teachers who were come among them.  The matters of faith contained in this Epistle are exceedingly sublime, and consequently very difficult to be understood.  It was written about twenty-nine years after our Lord's Ascension.","ch":[{"name":"Ephesians Chapter 1","desc":"The great blessings we have received through Christ.
