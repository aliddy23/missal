He was sent by the Lord, in the second year of the reign of king Darius, the son of Hystaspes, to exhort Zorobabel the prince of Juda, and Jesus the high priest, to the building of the temple; which they had begun, but left off again through the opposition of the Samaritans.  In consequence of this exhortation they proceeded in the building and finished the temple.  And the prophet was commissioned by the Lord to assure them that this second temple should be more glorious than the former, because the Messiah should honour it with his presence:  signifying withal how much the church of the New Testament should excel that of the Old Testament.","ch":[{"name":"Aggeus Chapter 1","desc":"The people are reproved for neglecting to build the temple.
